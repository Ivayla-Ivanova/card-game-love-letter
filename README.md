## Card game 'Love Letter'
This project aims to create a simulator for the card game Love Letter. "Love Letter" is a popular card game designed for 2 to 4 players. It's a quick and easy-to-learn game that typically takes around 15 minutes to play. The game is set in the context of courtly intrigue and romance, where players aim to deliver their love letter to the Princess while navigating the complexities of the royal court. The objective of the game is to be the last player standing or to have the highest-ranked card in hand when the draw pile runs out.

Components:
The game consists of a deck of 16 cards, each featuring a different character from the royal court. Some of the characters include the Princess, the King, the Baron, the Priest, and the Guard.

Gameplay:
At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt one card from the deck, and the remaining cards are placed face-down in a draw pile. On their turn, players draw one card from the draw pile and then discard one of the two cards in their hand, applying the effect of the discarded card if applicable. The goal is to use the special abilities of the cards strategically to eliminate other players or to protect oneself from elimination. For example, the Guard allows players to guess another player's hand, potentially eliminating them from the round if guessed correctly. The Baron forces players to compare hands, with the lower-ranked card being eliminated. The Princess is the highest-ranked card and is eliminated if discarded.

The round ends when there is only one player left standing or when the draw pile runs out. Players earn a token of affection (represented by a red cube or token) for winning a round, and the first player to earn a certain number of tokens wins the game.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
